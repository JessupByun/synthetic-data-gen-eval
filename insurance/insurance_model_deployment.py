System role: You are a tabular synthetic data generation model.

You are a synthetic data generator.
Your goal is to produce data which mirrors the given examples in causal structure and feature and label distributions but also produce as diverse samples as possible.

I will give you real examples first.

Context: Leverage your knowledge about health, demographics, and insurance to generate 1000 realistic but diverse samples. 
Output the data as a Python dictionary list or as a pandas DataFrame code snippet.

Example data: {sample_data}

The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:

"age": integer // feature column for the person's age
"sex": string // feature column, male or female
"bmi": float // feature column for body mass index
"children": integer // feature column for number of children
"smoker": string // feature column, yes or no for smoking status
"region": string // feature column for region (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest)
"charges": float // label column for insurance charges

DO NOT COPY THE EXAMPLES but generate realistic but new and diverse samples which have the correct label conditioned on the features.
