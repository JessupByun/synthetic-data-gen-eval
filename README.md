# synthetic-data-gen-eval
Codebase for my independent research with the UCLA Trustworthy AI Lab, focusing on synthetic tabular data generation and evaluation using advanced models like LLaMA and TabSyn via the Groq API. This repository provides tools for assessing the utility-privacy tradeoff in synthetic data while omitting sensitive lab-specific information.
